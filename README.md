# American Option Pricing with Least Squares Monte Carlo

This project was completed in December 2018 for the course *STA 3431: Monte Carlo Methods* during my master's degree at the University of Toronto. For this project, I implemented the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm in Python to find the price of an American put option written on Netflix's stock. The Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm is the process in which one uses least-squares Monte Carlo to compute the optimal exercise time and corresponding price for American-style options. I also employed the variance reduction techniques of moment matching and antithetic variates to improve the consistency of the Monte Carlo estimate.

Included in this repository is a detailed report (*LSMC-Report*) in which the algorithm and variance reduction techniques are presented in detail, as well as the subsequent results. I also elected to experiment more with modules in Python for this project, so the code is split into three .py files. The main part of the project is in the file *MCmainProject.py* and it depends on the two other .py files. *Options.py* includes functions for simulating asset prices using three approaches: without variance reduction, with antithetic variates and with moment matching. Then the file *LSM.py* contains fuctions that run the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm for each of the three approaches.
